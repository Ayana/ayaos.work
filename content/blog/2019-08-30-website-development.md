Hello friends, I started to develop this website because first of all, I wanted to learn React, Gatsby and Netlify. And also I would like to have the platform that I could show what I do now.

I've been developing and designing websites for more than 13 years after graduation from collage. I actually didn't like digital technology and I was thinking this is not my type of work in the beginning.

But as I learn a lot of new technologies, I realized this is really fun things to do and I thought I would like to learn more and develop by myself what I imagine.

Now I really like to code and have a passion to learn this such an interesting cutting edge technology.

So this website is going to be my playground to try new things out and express myself.

I'm going to update this website when I have time sometimes.

That's all for now:)
