Hello friends! I'm Ayana originally from Japan and live in NYC. This page is going to be my quick introduction. I would be glad to talk to you if you have something we can share about these topics below, or other topics too!

<h3>Job Experience</h3>
I have over 13 years experience in web design & development with skills of UI/UX Design, XHTML/CSS, JavaScript, WordPress, Web Marketing etc.

I've started to work in a digital industry in Tokyo. It was a rough time for me back then because I had to work so hard everyday and I couldn't have enough time to sleep. 

However, I really like what I do now. I have a passion to learn new technologies and hopefully I would like to use my skills more for creating fun projects.

More my career detail is on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayana-osawa-22b623b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>

<!--* **What I want to do**<br>

1. I would like to establish the life between Japan and New York. Especially, I have an interesting old house in Japan and it's going to be great if I could connect 

2. I would like to 

After all, the important thing for me is enjoying the life with close friends and people and hopefully make them happy, I would say. \

I would like to support local businesses, services related to food, communities for people using my experiences and technologies.-->

<h3>Where I live</h3>
I'm now based on New York and Nagano(Japan) for some reason. Mostly family things.

I love New York so much because I could get so much energy from surprisingly energetic people here and could learn a lot of things that I didn't know.

Of course, I love Japan. There's amazing culture and great foods there. Especially I love Sushi:)
But what I'm thinking now is that I would like to get global sense with communicating people from all over the world. This sounds like a big talk haha. Well, honestly, I would like to enjoy my life in the world, wherever I am.

The thing is - this is what I've been telling myself, where you live is not big deal. I know it does. The way you live depends on the country or the place. But luckily we have technologies, internet, message Apps! That means it doesn't matter where you live in this new generation. Important thing is what you do, what you want to do. So I've always been trying not to forget what's in my mind now.

<h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
I've stated rock climbing 2012. My coworker at that time took me to a climbing gym in Tokyo. It was super fun! Then my husband also hooked into it as well. We still climb like on and off eventually.
