Hello world! I'm Ayana.
I'm going to write these topics below soon...

* Experience<br>
  Over 13 years experience in web design & development
* My passion<br>
I would like to support local businesses, services related to food, communities for people using my experiences and technologies.
* How I can express about me<br>
  The term "UI/UX" is a trend word to express my work but I would prefer to say "Information Archtect" or "Web Developer"...
* Where you are<br>
  It doesn't matter where you live in this new generation.
* Why I like climbing
